        <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
        <p>Since starting my Computer Science program in January 2018, I've spent five years enhancing my programming and development skills, driven by a passion for technology and web development. My journey includes leading IT projects and implementing IT infrastructures.</p>

        <p>In this program, I've honed crucial skills such as attention to detail, a security-focused mindset, and organization. Testing and developing code in manageable blocks have become integral to my workflow, ensuring that my projects are secure and free of vulnerabilities. Embracing a tester's mindset has enhanced my ability to produce reliable software.</p>

            <p><em>Figure 1 - OpenGL ZigZag Chair - CS330 Computational Graphics and Visualization</em></p>
        </div>

        <p>Attention to detail is vital in code reviews, security standards, and best practices. Adopting a security-first approach helps me develop secure, maintainable software. Seeking peer feedback improves my work and fosters collaboration and communication skills.</p>

        <p>Through the Software Development Lifecycle, I've learned the importance of project management and team coordination. Understanding client needs translates into effective algorithms and pseudocode, making the development process rewarding. My soft skills, including creativity, communication, and time management, have also flourished.</p>
