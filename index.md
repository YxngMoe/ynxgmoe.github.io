## Professional Self-Assessment

Since starting my Computer Science program in January 2018, I've spent five years enhancing my programming and development skills, driven by a passion for technology and web development. My journey includes leading IT projects and implementing IT infrastructures.

In this program, I've honed crucial skills such as attention to detail, a security-focused mindset, and organization. Testing and developing code in manageable blocks have become integral to my workflow, ensuring that my projects are secure and free of vulnerabilities. Embracing a tester's mindset has enhanced my ability to produce reliable software.

Attention to detail is vital in code reviews, security standards, and best practices. Adopting a security-first approach helps me develop secure, maintainable software. Seeking peer feedback improves my work and fosters collaboration and communication skills.

Through the Software Development Lifecycle, I've learned the importance of project management and team coordination. Understanding client needs translates into effective algorithms and pseudocode, making the development process rewarding. My soft skills, including creativity, communication, and time management, have also flourished.

| **Hard Skills** | **Soft Skills** |
|:-----------:|:-----------:|
| Computer and Technology Skills | Organizational |
| Data Analysis | Attention to Detail |
| Data Visualization | Critical Thinking |
| Programming | Problem Solving |
| Software Development | Collaboration |
| Web Development | HTML/CSS/JS/Markdown |
| Technical Writing| JAVA |
| Security Mindset | Python |
| Mobile Development | C++ |

I've grown in my ability to quickly learn new skills, solve problems with humility, and lead with confidence. These skills and my passion for technology make me a strong candidate for a software engineering role, focused on creating understandable and maintainable algorithms.

</blockquote>

Each course in the Computer Science program has significantly contributed to my skill set. Here, I showcase artifacts demonstrating the knowledge and abilities gained from these impactful courses.

Courses like CS250 (Software Development Lifecycle) taught me the importance of teamwork and client communication. IT145 (Foundation in Application Development) and CS260 (Data Structures and Algorithms) deepened my understanding of algorithms and data structures. CS310 (Collaboration and Team Project) emphasized the necessity of teamwork for large projects.

Courses like CS360 (Mobile Architecture and Programming) and CS330 (Computational Graphics and Visualization) opened my mind to software design and engineering complexities. Through these, I demonstrated my ability to implement computing solutions that meet industry-specific goals. CS340 (Client/Server Development) and DAT220 (Fundamentals of Data Mining) highlighted the value of databases in collaborative environments.

The artifacts selected for code review in software design, algorithms, and databases reflect my learning and competency in the program.
