The program has equipped me with the skills, knowledge, and experiences needed to succeed in the field of computers.

Throughout my studies, I have improved my ability to work in some small teams, to discuss effectively with stakeholders, and apply key principles in data structures and algorithms. In my CS360 class, I collaborated with a team to develop and build a full-stack mobile application in Java. This experience not only improved my technical skills, but also emphasized the importance of effective communication and cooperation in meeting project objectives. Similarly, my degree in software engineering and databases has given me the knowledge and abilities necessary to create complex software programs. For example, in CS340, I built a web application dashboard for an animal sanctuary with Python, Flask, and MongoDB. This project expanded my knowledge of data processing efficiency and user-friendly design.

Security has been a key topic throughout my education. I've learnt the value of securing software systems against vulnerabilities and threats. A major effort involves improving a C++ application with validation and providing a binary search for bid ID retrieval. This proved my abilities to increase software security and performance.

My ePortfolio demonstrates my complete skill set and experiences. The associated artifacts demonstrate my skills in software design and engineering, data structures and algorithms, and database administration. They demonstrate my commitment to developing safe, efficient, and user-friendly software solutions. The first artifact is a React-based internet application that I originally built as a personal ePortfolio. I later enhanced it with the Next.js framework, adding more components to improve the UI/UX. This project demonstrates my abilities to design and construct complicated software systems, as well as provide intuitive user interfaces. 

The second artifact is a C++ program that efficiently stores and retrieves bid information using a binary search tree. This artifact was created for CS260 to demonstrate my mastery of C++ and sorting algorithms. I upgraded the application by adding validation and refining the search capabilities, which increased its efficiency and usability. The final artifact is a web application dashboard for the Grazioso Salvare Animal Shelter, which was developed for CS340. It demonstrates my proficiency with Python, Dash, Flask, MongoDB, and Plotly. The changes I made increased data processing efficiency, showcasing my ability to optimize code and provide successful database solutions.

To summarize, finishing my studies and establishing my ePortfolio have helped me prepare for a future in computer science. These experiences have provided me with the technical skills and professional qualities required to flourish in this sector. As I look forward to future chances, I am convinced that my education has equipped me to make important contributions to the field of computer science. This professional self-assessment serves as an introduction to my portfolio, emphasizing the breadth of my skills and abilities while also exhibiting my preparedness to thrive in the field of computer science.

Throughout my ePortfolio, I demonstrate a variety of abilities that are relevant to major goals from my curriculum and computer science activities. I thrive in creating collaborative spaces and assisting various audiences with organizational decision-making. My capacity to communicate well in oral, written, and visual formats is clear, and I adjust fluidly to different circumstances and audiences. I have great skills in creating and assessing computer systems based on algorithmic principles, making informed design decisions while providing solutions that satisfy industry requirements.

## REFINEMENT PLAN AND CODE REVIEW

Before finishing my ePortfolio objects, I did an informal code review to discuss my objectives for changes and enhancements. This method guarantees that my portfolio fulfills high software development standards and is successfully aligned with course objectives. Here's a summary of the improvements made to each artifact:

For artifact 1, The original version of the React-based internet application had a simple user interface with fundamental features. During the code analysis phase, I worked to improve the organization, logic, efficiency, functionality, security, testing, commenting, and documentation. This involved rebuilding the component hierarchy to improve scalability and maintainability, improving state management for better performance, and introducing client-side validation to ensure secure data processing. I also increased the application's capabilities to incorporate dynamic content loading and improved user interaction. Furthermore, I included Next.js for server-side rendering, which improved SEO and initial load efficiency. These changes demonstrate my proficiency with React.js, Next.js, UI/UX design, state management, and secure coding methods.

For artifact 2 initially, the C++ binary search tree software used a binary search tree structure to effectively maintain bid information. Through extensive code analysis, I discovered opportunities for improvement in structure, logic, efficiency, functionality, and security. I improved the binary search method to speed up bid ID retrieval and included rigorous input validation to assure data integrity. 

For artifact 3, originally created for the CS340 class, the web application dashboard allowed users to filter data, view tables, and explore charts and maps relating to rescue operations. During the code analysis phase, I discovered ways to improve the structure, functionality, efficiency, and security. I focused on improving data retrieval and processing by utilizing sophisticated MongoDB capabilities. This improved the dashboard in a wholistic technical view, particularly when dealing with huge datasets, and guaranteed effective data management.

## ARTIFACTS

### Artifact 1: Software Design and Engineering
**Before Enhancement**  
This year, I focused on enhancing my ePortfolio by integrating comprehensive course resources into the React page. This task involved substantial system design and the development of new components, showcasing my proficiency in software design and engineering as outlined in the assignment rubric. 

**After Enhancement**  
Artifact 1 in my ePortfolio now includes an updated React-based web application that I created as part of my CS499 course. This update is a key milestone in my career as a software engineer, demonstrating my ability to integrate complicated system architectures and improve the functioning of a web application. The project began as a basic React application, but with subsequent updates, it now contains full course resources that demonstrate a deeper grasp and application of advanced software design principles.

To increase the project's complexity, I focused on a few important improvements. First, I incorporated several course resources into the React application, which necessitated considerable system architecture and the development of new components to handle many capabilities flawlessly. This included adopting advanced state management techniques and ensuring that data was handled efficiently. I also updated the general architecture by streamlining the component structure and increasing the application's responsiveness, which dramatically improved usability and performance.

Furthermore, I redesigned the user interface to make it more intuitive and user-friendly. The program's usability and visual appeal improved by adopting new design ideas and flexible layouts. These upgrades not only complicate the project but also need a thorough understanding of contemporary web design and user experience principles. Overall, the modifications to the React website demonstrate my ability to handle challenging problems and come up with unique solutions, which marks a watershed point in my software development career.

### Artifact 2: Data Structures & Algorithms
**Before Enhancement**  
The artifact for your ePortfolio is a C++ application that uses a binary search tree data structure to store bid information and allows the user to rapidly search for a certain bid ID. It was first developed in February 2023 for CS 260. I chose this item for my ePortfolio because it exhibits my knowledge of C++ and ability to apply sorting algorithms to bespoke data structures. Specifically, the artifact demonstrates my ability to create and deconstruct bespoke data structures, as well as my ability to apply complicated logic. Especially with technical interviews being based on these types of algorithms, it was great practice and achieved successfully.

**After Enhancement**
